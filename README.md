- 👋 Hi, I’m @nmuniz66
- 👀 I’m only interested in contacting GitHub.
- 🌱 I’ve downloaded a few apps from them, for 
example Spotiflyer and made a reasonable donation 
for it, and could only use it once or twice, 
now It doesn't want to work.
- 💞️ I want to know what to do.
- 📫 How to reach me, nmuniz66@hotmail.com...
